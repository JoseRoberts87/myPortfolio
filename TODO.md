## Development Workflow

**Branching Strategy**: See `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` for complete details.

### Quick Reference
1. **Create branch** from main: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`
2. **Implement & commit** changes with descriptive messages
3. **Push to GitHub**: `git push -u origin feature/<feature-name>`
4. **Wait for PR creation** - User will create and review PR
5. **Address feedback** - Make changes in same branch and push
6. **After merge** - Pull main and delete local branch

**Branch Types**:
- `feature/<name>` - New features
- `bugfix/<name>` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/<name>` - Code refactoring
- `docs/<name>` - Documentation updates
