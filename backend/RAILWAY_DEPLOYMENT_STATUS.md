```

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **FastAPI Application** - Running successfully on Railway
2. **PostgreSQL Database** - Connected and initialized
3. **Database Tables** - Created successfully (via lifespan event in app/main.py:24)
4. **Reddit API Connection** - Configured and working
5. **CORS** - Configured for your frontend
6. **Health Checks** - Passing
7. **Auto-deployment** - Connected to GitHub main branch

## üìã Deployment Configuration

### Files Created/Modified

1. **railway.toml** - Railway deployment configuration
   - Uses Railpack builder (modern, automatic detection)
   - Health check on `/health` endpoint
   - 5-minute timeout for healthchecks
   - Retry policy on failure

2. **app/main.py** - Updated with lifespan event
   - Database initialization runs on startup (app/main.py:15-38)
   - Creates tables automatically when container starts
   - Graceful error handling

3. **app/db/database.py** - Lazy database initialization
   - Connection created only when needed
   - Prevents import-time connection errors

### Environment Variables Configured

Based on the working endpoints, these are already set in Railway:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:***@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=nYg3Csn9hFfC94yQaqGdRw
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=SYWRXn2U7yAkwUxe57T2q83IWue7bg
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=portfolio-app:v1.0.0 (by /u/your_username)
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://portfolio-60sng8hin-joseroberts87s-projects.vercel.app
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

### 1. Test Data Collection

The pipeline is ready to collect data. Run it manually:

```bash
# Collect posts from the last day
curl -X POST "https://myportfolio-production-d468.up.railway.app/api/v1/pipeline/run?time_filter=day"

# Wait a minute, then check if data was collected
curl "https://myportfolio-production-d468.up.railway.app/api/v1/reddit/posts" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Note:** If no data appears after the pipeline runs, check Railway logs in the dashboard:
1. Go to your service ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest Deployment ‚Üí View Logs
2. Look for any errors during the pipeline execution
3. The pipeline runs in the background, so you won't see immediate results

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration

Update your Next.js frontend to use the Railway backend:

**In your frontend repository:**

```typescript
// .env.local or .env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://myportfolio-production-d468.up.railway.app
```

Then redeploy your Vercel frontend.

### 3. Set Up Scheduled Pipeline (Optional)

To automatically refresh data periodically, you can:

**Option A: Use Railway Cron**
1. Go to Railway project ‚Üí + New ‚Üí Cron Job
2. Set schedule (e.g., `0 */6 * * *` for every 6 hours)
3. Set command: `curl -X POST "https://myportfolio-production-d468.up.railway.app/api/v1/pipeline/run?time_filter=day"`

**Option B: Use an external cron service**
- Use services like cron-job.org or EasyCron
- Schedule HTTP POST requests to your pipeline endpoint

### 4. Monitor Deployment

**View Logs:**
```bash
# Using Railway CLI (if service is linked)
railway logs --lines 100
```

Or in Railway Dashboard:
- Go to your service
- Click "Deployments" tab
- Select latest deployment
- Click "View Logs"

**Key log messages to look for:**
```
INFO:__main__:Starting up - initializing database...
INFO:__main__:‚úì Database initialized successfully! Tables: ['reddit_posts']
```

## üéØ API Endpoints Available

### Health & Info
- `GET /` - API information
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` - OpenAPI documentation

### Reddit Data
- `GET /api/v1/reddit/posts` - Get posts (with pagination)
  - Query params: `?subreddit=python&page=1&page_size=50`
- `GET /api/v1/reddit/posts/{post_id}` - Get specific post
- `POST /api/v1/reddit/test-connection` - Test Reddit API

### Pipeline
- `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run` - Run data collection
  - Query params: `?time_filter=day|week|month|year|all`
- `GET /api/v1/pipeline/status` - Pipeline status

## üìä Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database has been initialized with:

**Table: reddit_posts**
- id (primary key)
- post_id (unique Reddit ID)
- title
- author
- subreddit
- created_at
- score
- url
- num_comments
- selftext
- fetched_at

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If pipeline doesn't collect data:

1. **Check logs** in Railway dashboard for errors
2. **Verify Reddit credentials** are set correctly in Railway variables
3. **Test Reddit connection:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://myportfolio-production-d468.up.railway.app/api/v1/reddit/test-connection
   ```
4. **Try running pipeline with different time filters:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://myportfolio-production-d468.up.railway.app/api/v1/pipeline/run?time_filter=week"
   ```

### If database errors occur:

1. **Verify DATABASE_URL** is set correctly in Railway
   - Should be: `postgresql://postgres:...@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway`
2. **Check PostgreSQL service** is running in Railway project
3. **Check logs** for database initialization errors

### If CORS errors occur:

1. **Verify CORS_ORIGINS** includes your frontend URL
2. **Update variable** in Railway if needed
3. **Redeploy** after changing variables

## üí∞ Railway Costs

Current configuration:
- **PostgreSQL:** ~$5/month (after free trial)
- **Web Service:** Based on usage
- **Estimated total:** $5-10/month

Railway provides a generous free tier for testing.
