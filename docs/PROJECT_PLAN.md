## Implementation Strategy

**Phased Approach (Deep Dive)**:
- Build 1-2 expertise areas thoroughly before moving to the next
- Focus on quality and depth over breadth
- Each section should be production-ready before proceeding

**Data Theme**: Social Media Analytics
- Primary data source: Reddit API, Twitter/X API
- Cohesive narrative across pipeline → analytics → ML sections
- ML focus: Sentiment analysis of social media posts
- CV focus: Real-time object detection with webcam
